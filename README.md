[Local Ease Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/yFsDYsI2yv29lF80zF1oZy/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=6Lcuu5cNbQVoTpSQ-1)

Good morning everyone, we are from the team Local Ease and today we are here to present our idea on the problem statement of Water Supply Management. Our presentation will address issues such as:

- Inability to identify and address water wastage or leakages
- Difficulties in ensuring equitable water distribution
- Accumulating data to support decision-making

## Project Overview

After thorough discussion, we have decided to leverage IoT technology in our project. Our solution involves the installation of a microcontroller like the Ambiq Apollo 3 in water meters, equipped with pressure and volume sensors. These sensors serve as inputs to the microcontroller.

### Why Ambiq Apollo 3?

The primary reasons for choosing the Ambiq Apollo 3 microcontroller are:
- **High Battery Life:** Ensures long-term operation without frequent battery replacements.
- **Low Power Consumption:** Ideal for IoT applications where energy efficiency is crucial.

### Microcontroller Functionality

The microcontroller will:
- **Collect Data:** Gather data from the pressure and volume sensors.
- **Transmit Data:** Send the collected data to the server, facilitating real-time monitoring and decision-making through our website.

### Website Features

The website will serve as the user interface for the water supply management system. Key features include:

#### Loading Page
- **Login and Signup Links:** Allows users to access their accounts.
- **Important Updates:** Displays essential information like water supply timings.

#### User Dashboard
- **Meter Reading:** Users can check their current water meter readings.
- **Complaint Management:** Users can add and track complaints related to water supply issues.
- **Online Bill Payment:** Allows users to pay their water bills online.
- **Usage Data:** Users can view their historical water usage data.

## Code and Implementation

The detailed code for the microcontroller, as shown in our presentation, outlines the process of data collection and transmission to the server. This backend functionality supports the seamless operation of the website features.

## Conclusion

Our IoT-based solution aims to enhance water supply management by addressing critical issues such as water wastage, equitable distribution, and data-driven decision-making. Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to discussing our project further.
